You need to install:
Core
Emane
Nrlolsr
BonnMotion
Maven (you'll perhaps need to manually install soot-framework-2.5.0.jar into the local mvn repository
using the suggested mvn install ... when mvn clean compile assembly:single fails).
olsrd 0.6.3 from ppa at https://launchpad.net/~guardianproject/+archive/ubuntu/commotion (Don't forget to update before installing!).
