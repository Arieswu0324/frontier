You need to install:
Core
Emane
Nrlolsr
BonnMotion
Maven (you'll perhaps need to manually install soot-framework-2.5.0.jar into the local mvn repository
using the suggested mvn install ... when mvn clean compile assembly:single fails).
olsrd 0.6.3 from ppa at https://launchpad.net/~guardianproject/+archive/ubuntu/commotion (Don't forget to update before installing!).
For 14.04 can just install olsrd from apt-get directly.
python pandas
python utm
Then apply diff to core.
Then apply diff to emane?
Then update olsrd config?
Then need to point core config to acita config dir.
Then need to update /etc/hosts.
Then need to update core config (e.g. for control net).
